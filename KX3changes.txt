Changes to KX3.cxx (and others) to improve the functionality with the Elecraft KX3 radio.

KX3.cxx & .h

Support.cxx (comments only)

KX3ui.cxx & .h

Mic, RF(gain) Power and Volume sliders now work correctly.
The RF Gain control especially, see the Elecraft K3&KX3 programmers reference, "E18" page 21
for details.

Todo:
Sort out the split,swap A/B, and A B selection anomalies

Fix the wayward default IF shift values

Commented the (unused for now) shutdown function.

IFsh seems to just send whatever value the slider is set to, for turning on, or off.

Changing from vfoB to A also turns off IFshift, snd sets the slider to 1500.
Going from B to A, doesnt.

A/B, just seems to set VFOA frequency, mode and BW.

Added comments in:-
support.cxx
KX3_ui.cxx
KX3_ui.h
rigpanel.cxx
rigpanel.h
All relating to the odd behaviour of the Swap A/B button.
It appears (trapping things in the debugger) that the A/B button used in the panel when
the KX3 is used, is the general button, NOT the KX3 specific one.

For now, the VFO Swap A/B functionality is unusable.
as one or other VFO setting is wiped out, as a result of the software polling scheme!

Also struggling to decypher the logic of the IFshift function.
Need some hints as to program flow, when a user clicks on or alters something in the UI.

Found and corrected the default IF center value for Data modes.

Added event monitoring calls to several on/off button controls.
