\section sFlrigDesc Transceiver Control

FLRIG is a transceiver control program designed to be used either stand
alone or as an adjunct to FLDIGI.  The supported transceivers all have some
degree of CAT.  The FLRIG user interface changes to accommodate the degree
of CAT support available for the transceiver in use.

Three different main dialog aspect ratios can be selected to suit the
computer screen dimensions and operator preferences.  The wide aspect
ratio can be resized horizontally.  The narrow aspect ratios are fixed
in width and height.

\section sSetUp Setup

Select the transceiver with the "Config / Xcvr select" menu item.

<center>
\image latex config-menu.png "" width=1.6in
\image html config-menu.png ""
</center>
<br>

Check:

<ul>
	<li><b>Restore Freq/Mode</b> and FLRIG will read the current frequency /
	    mode from the transceiver at start. It will then restore those at
	    exit.</li>
	<li><b>Keep Freq/Mode</b> and FLRIG use the transceiver frequency and
	    mode for it's initial startup values.</li>
	<li><b>Tooltips</b> and a small popup information box will appear above
	    most controls when the mouse is allowed to hover over the control.</li>
	<li><b>Small sliders</b> to compress the user interface as above in the
	    right hand panel.</li>
</ul>

<br>

Select the rig in use from the "Rig" combo box.

The default values associated with that transceiver will be preset for you.
These have been verified by the test team but might require some tweaking for
your particular h/w.

You may prefer to use h/w PTT signaling instead of CAT PTT.  Not all
transceivers support the CAT PTT function, but it will be preset to on
if the selected transceiver supports that command.  The h/w PTT may be
shared with the CAT serial port.

If your serial connection is a CI-V device you might need to check "Echo"
and also set either RTS or DTR to +12 if CI-V power is derived from the
serial port.


<center>
\image latex ptt.png "I/O Ports - PTT" width=4.9in

Your PTT h/w control may also make use of a second serial port.

<center>

\image html aux-controls.png "Aux Controls"
</center>
<br>

You might also need access to special h/w functions.  FLRIG provides this
via the DTR and RTS signal lines of an independent serial port.  Additional
main dialog controls are enabled and shown if you select anything other than
NONE (the default) on this tab.

\image latex polling.png "I/O Ports - Polling" width=4.9in

<br>

Providing you transceiver supports the various meters and controls, you
can elect to poll these every time the poll cycle occurs.  Polling a value
causes FLRIG to follow and well as control a particular transceiver function
or control.  The polling cycle will slow down as you elect to poll more and
more values.

<center>
\image latex send-cmd.png "I/O Ports - Polling" width=4.9in

<br>

Testing your transceiver commands.  FLRIG might not support a particular CAT
command for your transceiver.  You can test the support for a particular
command using the "Send Cmd" tab.  The command string must comply with the
transceiver requirements.  If ASCII text is used, as with transceivers based
on the Kenwood command set you enter the string without spaces, i.e.

\verbatim
FA;
\endverbatim
to read the A vfo .

For binary strings, used in older Yaesu transceivers, and all Icom CI-V type
transceivers you need to enter the string as space delineated hex values,
i.e.

\verbatim
Yaesu:  x00 x00 x00 x01 x05

Icom: xFE xFE x70 xE0 x1A x05 x00 x92 x00 xFD
\endverbatim

Press the SEND button to transfer the command to the transceiver.  The
response will appear in the lower text control.

Additional control settings may be available depending on the transceiver
being controlled.  These are in a drop-down area toggled by the arrow button
to the left of the attenuator button on the small aspect ratio dialog view.
These are the controls for the Yeasu FT950.

sliders and a dialog layout that uses less vertical space.

<br>

Right click on the main dialog power meter scale to open up this selection
dialog.  Each of the 4 scales and the "Auto scaled" box are buttons.  Press
the one you want to use.  Auto-scaling adjusts the meter scale to the
smallest scale consistent with the current measured peak power.  If that
power is fluctuating near the transistion point between two scales you
might want to fix the scale to either the larger or smaller.

\section sOpControls Operating Controls


<center>
\image latex frequency-control.png "Frequency Control" width=4.6in
\image html frequency-control.png "Frequency Control"
</center>
<br>

The frequency display is also a control.  Each numeric is sensitive to mouse
left/right buttons for up/down and to the mouse scroll wheel for rapidly
changing value.  Put the mouse over any of the numeric segments and you
can enter a new frequency using the keyboard numeric keypad.  If you make an
error simply enter a non-numeric key.  Set the newly entered frequency by
pressing the Enter key.

To paste a frequency from the clipboard (kHz only), press control-V followed
by the Enter key

Vfo-A and Vfo-B are separate control, A on the left, B on the right.

Left click on the A->B button to swap vfos.  Right click on the A->B button
to transfer vfoA to vfoB.

When the mouse pointer is over the frequency display you can also change
frequency values using the arrow and page key buttons:

<ul>
	<li>left / right arrow - increase / decrease 1 Hz</li>
	<li>up / down arrow - increase / decrease 10 Hz</li>
	<li>Page Up / Page Down - increase / decrease 100 Hz</li>
</ul>
<br>

\image latex buttons-sliders.png "Control Sliders" width=2.24in

<br>

The buttons that have a light box are toggles - activated when the lighted
box is colored.  Some of these are linked to a slider.  If the button state
is inactive then that associated slider will be greyed out.  In the example
the volume control is active and the NR control is inactive.

<br>

Operating FLRIG with FLDIGI requires a simple setup in FLDIGI.  Deselect all
but the "xmlrpc" rig control.  Xmlrpc is used via a local socket device for
the two programs to communicate.  FLDIGI acts as the server and FLRIG the
client.  There is no requirement for start / stop ordering of the programs.

FLRIG sends rig configuration data to FLDIGI when the two programs initially
recognize each other.  This data is used to populate the rig name, the
available modes and the available bandwidths.

After this initial communications the operator can set the paired controls
from either FLDIGI or FLRIG.  The two programs will remain synchronized.  The
data from the computer to the transceiver is always from FLRIG.

PTT can be activated at FLRIG or using the T/R button on FLDIGI.  FLDIGI
also engages the PTT via the macro <TX> <RX> tags.  When operating digital
modes with FLDIGI you should use the PTT from FLDIGI.

\subsection ssMeterFiltering Meter Filtering

<center>

<br>

You can control the behavior of both the average and peak values of the
S-meter and Power out meters.  Setting the controls to 1 for both average
and peak will simply display the latest value available from the
transceiver.  The average setting results in the display showing the
average of the last N readings.  The peak value will display the average
peak value over the last M readings.

serial and xmlrpc data exchanges between FLRIG, FLDIGI, and the
transceiver.
